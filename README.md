# Risk Assessment Report – Healthcare Clinic (NIST CSF)



## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **risk assessment** for a fictional healthcare clinic (“HealthyLife Clinic”) using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.  
The goal is to identify threats, assess risks, and recommend controls to reduce risk and strengthen overall security posture.

- 📄 **[Risk Assessment Report (PDF)](https://github.com/mhamadii/risk-assessment-healthcare/blob/main/Healthcare_Risk_Assessment_Report.pdf)**

## 🧭 Method (NIST CSF)
Identify assets → list threats/vulnerabilities → score **Impact** & **Likelihood** (H/M/L) → compute Risk Score → map to **Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover** → recommend controls.

## 🔎 Key Findings (sample)
- **Phishing → account takeover** (High × High = **9/Critical**): enable MFA, awareness training, block malicious senders.  
- **Ransomware on EMR** (High × Medium = **6/High**): patching cadence, EDR, tested offline/immutable backups.  
- **Lost/stolen laptops with PHI** (High × Medium = **6/High**): full-disk encryption, remote wipe, auto-lock.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Risk identification & documentation  
- Building a risk register (Excel) with scoring & CSF mapping  
- Writing a concise risk assessment report (PDF)  
- Translating findings into actionable controls

## 🏁 Status
✅ **Completed** – Final report (PDF) and risk register (Excel) are available above.
